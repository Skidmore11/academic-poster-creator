# Academic Poster Creator

Turn your research papers into beautiful academic posters with AI! Just upload a PDF and watch the magic happen.

## What This Does

Ever spent hours trying to fit your research into a poster template? This app does that for you. Upload your research paper (PDF), and it uses AI to pull out the important stuff and put it into a professional poster format.

## Features

- **AI Magic**: Uses ChatGPT or Claude to read your paper and extract the good stuff
- **Multiple Templates**: Choose from different poster styles
- **Add Your Figures**: Upload up to 4 images with descriptions
- **Smart Sizing**: Automatically adjusts text size so everything fits nicely
- **Easy to Use**: Just upload and download - no design skills needed

## What You Need

- Python 3.8 or newer
- An OpenAI API key (or Anthropic if you prefer Claude)
- That's it!

## Quick Start

### 1. Get the Code
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Skidmore11/academic-poster-creator.git
cd academic-poster-creator
```

### 2. Set It Up
```bash
python setup.py
```
This will create a virtual environment and install everything you need.

### 3. Add Your API Key
Edit the `.env` file and add your OpenAI API key:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here
```

### 4. Run It
```bash
python app.py
```
Open your browser to `http://localhost:5000`

## Getting an API Key

### OpenAI (Recommended)
1. Go to [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com)
2. Sign up (it's free)
3. Go to "API Keys" 
4. Click "Create new secret key"
5. Copy the key (starts with `sk-`)

### Anthropic (Alternative)
1. Go to [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com)
2. Sign up
3. Go to "API Keys"
4. Create a new key
5. Copy it (starts with `sk-ant-`)

## Putting It Online

### Railway (Easiest - 5 minutes)
1. Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. Sign up with GitHub
3. Click "New Project" â†’ "Deploy from GitHub repo"
4. Pick your repository
5. Add your API key in "Variables"

4. Connect your repo
5. Add your API key
6. Deploy!

## How It Works

1. **Upload**: You upload a research paper PDF
2. **AI Reads**: The AI reads through your paper and extracts:
   - Title and authors
   - Introduction and background
   - Methods and results
   - Conclusions and references
3. **Template**: It puts everything into a professional poster template
4. **Download**: You get a PowerPoint file ready to print

## Customization

### Adding New Templates
1. Create a PowerPoint template with named text boxes
2. Upload it through the web interface
3. The app will use it automatically

### Changing the AI Prompt
Edit the prompt in `app.py` if you want the AI to extract information differently.

### Styling
Modify the CSS in `templates/index.html` to change how the website looks.

## Troubleshooting

### "API key not configured"
- Make sure you added your API key to the `.env` file
- Check that the key starts with `sk-`

### "Module not found"
- Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Make sure you're in your virtual environment

### "Port already in use"
- Change the port in `app.py` or close other programs using port 5000

### Large files won't upload
- The limit is 500MB total
- Try compressing your images first

## Cost

- **OpenAI**: About $0.01-0.05 per poster (very cheap)
- **Anthropic**: Similar pricing
- **Hosting**: Free on Render, $5/month on Railway

## Security Notes

- Never commit your API keys to GitHub
- The app validates file types and sizes
- Use HTTPS in production (automatic on most platforms)
